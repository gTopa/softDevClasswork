Aim: Documenting your data

Downsides of sqlte:
-Cant change table
-Cant put in lists
-Tables have to be on same machine

NoSQL databases:
-Graph, map, document

Document-oriented databases

-records in document oriented databses are stored as documents
-each document contains all data that is associated w/ given record, in key value pairs (fields)
-documents in same collection dont need to have the same fields
-documents that are meant to be stored together put into collections
-dont need to specify type of data put into fields, fields can include lists or other documents
-each doc has its own primary key generated by mongo
-need db server running somewhere
