Aim: Mongo likes py

Working w/ pymongo:

from pymongo import MongoClient
server=MongoClient(<IP>) -> connects to mongodb server and db, use 149.89.150.100 when in stuy
to access db, go farther into db: db=server['mydb'], db=server.mydb
   	      	 	      	  c=db['students'], c=db.students
	*db, collections not crweated until a doc has been added to them

To add doc:
1. create dict
2. insert into collection
   dic={'name':'bob', 'age':65}
   c.insert_one(doc)
