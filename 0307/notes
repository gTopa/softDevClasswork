js event propagation
   Events initially propacgate downward from top most node in the DOM tree to target element. This is known as event capturing.
   After event reaches target it propagates back up the DOM tree. This is known as event bubbling
   By default event listeners dont trigger until even bubbling phase
   Triggering events at the capture phase can be done by adding <true> as a third arg to event listener
   Can cancel event propagation w/ e.stopPropagation();
